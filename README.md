I.	Introduction

Biological Entities are always changing, growing and decaying. Just as in the binary code for a computer software program, the current state of a biological entity has a total number, or a string of numbers that details every portion of body including living cells, organs, tissue and brain mater (dendrites and neurons). This total number can is output as a very specific field, vibration or resonance. 

Specific sounds and harmonies can be played to a container of water, sand or in scientific experimentation Lycopodium to create geometric formations which will hold in configuration as the harmony is applied to the substance. Fields affect atoms and molecules in the same fashion, creating the advanced geometric structures that create the lattice structures of complete biological organisms and all life on this planet.
Using highly advanced instrumentation, an individual can be scanned to attain the current total number in the form of the frequencies of the field which makes up the selected biological life form. The field or resonance of an individual can then be stored via computer storage. Depending on storage capability, multiple “bodies” or frequency fields can be stored at any one location.

Frequencies can be “dialed in” and applied to correct atomic yields to create a desired lattice structure template. An electric impulse can be applied to excite electrons in the lattice template created by emitted frequency, allowing electrons to come close enough to surrounding atoms in lattice template to create bonds necessary to become desired crystal lattice structure (solid, liquid, gas, triple point, plasma, etc.)


II.	Break down of Biological entity into Subatomic Particles

Bonds within a biological crystal lattice structure can be broken via electric shock. When you lose muscle control from electric shock and feel pain, it is because your elemental bonds are temporarily loosened. Your feel pain, your body heats up and cooks and eventually melts from friction of electrons and lattice structures breaking down into atomic soup.
Specific resonance can be used to shake the loosened lattice structure to break weakened bonds completely and allow manipulation of free atoms. A burst to vibration can turn free atoms into an atomic cloud which can be manipulated at the atomic level to achieve elemental yields needed for desired biological entity.

Specific bursts of energy are applied to free atoms within a gaseous cloud to eject protons and neutrons. Individual frequencies will only adhere or resonate to specific elemental atoms due to specific size and gross mass of specific particles. The input of energy which resonates to targeted elements shakes loose subatomic particles of the nucleus into a cloud of proton-neutron pairs and electrons.


III.	Reconstruction of subatomic particles and lattice structure template

To create yield of atoms of desired element, series of resonances are applied to proton-neutron pairs to vibrate these particles to create an electric induction or draw of field that attracts desired proton-neutron mass to create a desired elemental atom. Electrons from electron cloud draw to nucleus pairs creating a neutral charge.

To create isotopes, extra proton-neutron pairs are drawn into a nucleus via series of frequencies which induce a charge. Targeted nuclei groups are targeted with vibrational patterns specifically designed to induce enough current to attract only desired proton / neutron pairs. Once electrons are drawn to neutralize charge, nucleus is shaken with required energy to eject correct number of proton-neutron pairs to create element while maintaining electrons for desired isotope.

Every elemental atom or isotope has a specific mass, size and weight which corresponds to its number or nuclei and electrons. Sound Waves applied to a cloud of desired atomic yields create specific geometric formations which can be saved as a harmonic template. This harmonic template is applied to a geometric cloud to create a desired lattice structure of atoms, isotopes, molecules and biological material.

Pulses of electrical energy excite electrons within atoms which are arranged into a lattice template using harmonic frequency. These excited electrons form covenant and ionic bonds which were present when the lattice structure was templated. The field or resonance which your body produces is so important because it is a specific frequency which is unique to your person.
